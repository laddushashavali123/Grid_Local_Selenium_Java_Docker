========================================================================================================================
Step 1: Set up the proxy with jMeter that we are going to connect Selenium to as 3. Build-Record-Run scenario

Step 2: Run our Selenium tests and tell them to connect to the JMeter proxy
    - Run mvn clean install –DproxyEnabled=true –DproxyHost=localhost –DproxyPort=8080

Step 3:
